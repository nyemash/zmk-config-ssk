# zmk-config-ssk

Notice: There might be the right way to do this but this works for me. Just learned ZMK, GitHub and KiCad to do this project in a short period of time so this might be pretty rough for those who know what they are doing.

Description: Firmware to covert SSK to bluetooth using nice!nano v2 with one 595 shift registers running on ZMK.

Gerber files below. Never fabricated this one though. Made some adjustments with this one based on the mistakes I learned from the prior versini; which what I'm using.
